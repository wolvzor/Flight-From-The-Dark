    "You walk for nearly ten minutes along a dark and winding corridor, and then start to climb a steep staircase to a small wooden door."
    "The man presses a secret catch and the door opens. You enter a large, plushly decorated bedroom with a huge marble bath that takes up one corner of the room."
    "The man suggests that you refresh yourself here whilst he seeks an audience with the King."

    "You quickly bathe and change into some white robes that have been left out on a large marble table."
    "Shortly, the man returns and leads you through a long corridor lined with exquisite tapestries. You finally arrive at a large door guarded by two soldiers wearing silver armour."

    "You are about to meet the King."
