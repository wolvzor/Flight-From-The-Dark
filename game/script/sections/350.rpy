    "You enter the Chamber of State, a magnificent hall decorated lavishly in white and gold. The King and his closest advisers are studying a large map spread upon a marble plinth in the centre of the chamber."
    "Their faces are lined with worry and concentration. A silence fills the hall as you tell of the death of your kinsmen and of your perilous journey to the citadel."
    "As you finish your story, the King approaches and takes your right hand in his."

    "‘Lone Wolf, you have selfless courage: the quality of a true Kai Lord. Your journey here has been one of great peril and although your news comes as a grievous blow, the spirit of your determination is like a beacon of hope to us all in this dark hour.'"
    "'You have brought great honour to the memory of your Masters, and for that we praise you.’"

    "You receive the praise and heartfelt thanks of the entire hall—an honour that brings a certain redness to your young face. The King raises his hand and all the voices cease."

    "‘You have done all that Sommerlund could have asked of a loyal son, but she is greatly in need of you still.'"
    "'The Darklords are powerful once more and their ambition knows no bounds. Our only hope lies within Durenor with the power that once defeated the Darklords an age ago.'"
    "'Lone Wolf, you are the last of the Kai—you have the skills. Will you journey to Durenor and return with the Sommerswerd, the sword of the sun? Only with that gift of the gods may we crush this evil and save our land.’"

    "If you wish to accept the quest of the Sommerswerd, begin your adventure with Book 2 of the Lone Wolf adventures: Fire on the Water"
