    # Combat Rules
    # TODO some neat combat graphic thingy
    "There will be occasions on your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s COMBAT SKILL and ENDURANCE points are given in the text."
    "Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his ENDURANCE points to zero while losing as few ENDURANCE points as possible himself."

    "The sequence for combat is as follows."
    "Any extra points gained through Kai Disciplines is added to your current COMBAT SKILL total."
    "This is subtracted from the COMBAT SKILL of your enemy. The result is your Combat Ratio."
    "Once the Combat Ratio is determined, a random number is picked from the Random Number Table."
    "The Combat Results Table is then used to determine the ENDURANCE points lost by Lone Wolf and their enemy in this round of combat."
    "Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat starts, using the above sequence."

    "This process of combat continues until the ENDURANCE points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead."
    "If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his ENDURANCE points possibly reduced."

    # Evasion of Combat
    # TODO picture of evasion maybe?
    "During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat."
    "If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner."
    "All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape."
    "Only Lone Wolf may lose ENDURANCE points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so."
