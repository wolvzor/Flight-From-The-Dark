    "As you reach the walls of the fieldworks, the large oak gates open and you are quickly hurried inside. A sergeant, bloodstained and battle-weary, calls to an officer who turns and recognizes your cloak."

    "‘My Lord,’ he says. ‘Where are the other Kai Masters? We are in desperate need of their wisdom. The Darklords press us most cruelly and casualties are high.’"

    "You inform the brave officer of the terrible fate of your kinsmen, and the urgency of your mission to seek the King’s council."
    "Without saying a word, he motions to a soldier to bring forward two horses. You both mount and gallop off towards the high city wall of Holmgard."
