    "In the northern land of Sommerlund, it has been the custom for many centuries to send the children of the Warrior Lords to the monastery of Kai."

    "There they are taught the skills and disciplines of their noble fathers."

    "The Kai monks are masters of their art, and the children in their charge love and respect them in spite of the hardships of their training."

    "For one day when they have finally learnt the secret skills of the Kai, they will return to their homes equipped in mind and body to defend themselves against the constant threat of war from the Darklords of the west."

    "In olden times, during the Age of the Black Moon, the Darklords waged war on Sommerlund."

    "The conflict was a long and bitter trial of strength that ended in victory for the Sommlending at the great battle of Maakengorge."

    "King Ulnar and the allies of Durenor broke the Darkland armies at the pass of Moytura and forced them back into the bottomless abyss of Maakengorge."

    "Vashna, mightiest of the Darklords, was slain upon the sword of King Ulnar, called ‘Sommerswerd’, the sword of the sun."

    "Since that age, the Darklords have vowed vengeance upon Sommerlund and the House of Ulnar."

    "Now it is in the morning of the feast of Fehmarn, when all of the Kai Lords are present at the monastery for the celebrations."

    "Suddenly a great black cloud comes from out of the western skies."

    "So many are the numbers of the black-winged beasts that fill the sky, that the sun is completely hidden."

    "The Darklords, ancient enemy of the Sommlending, are attacking. War has begun."

    "On this fateful morning, you, Silent Wolf (the name given to you by the Kai) have been sent to collect firewood in the forest as a punishment for your inattention in class."

    "As you are preparing to return, you see to your horror a vast cloud of black leathery creatures swoop down and engulf the monastery."

    "Dropping the wood, you race to the battle that has already begun."

    "But in the unnatural dark, you stumble and strike your head on a low tree branch."

    "As you lose consciousness, the last thing that you see in the poor light is the walls of the monastery crashing to the ground."

    "Many hours pass before you awake."

    "With tears in your eyes you now survey the scene of destruction."

    "Raising your face to the clear sky, you swear vengeance on the Darklords for the massacre of the Kai warriors, and with a sudden flash of realization you know what you must do."

    "You must set off on a perilous journey to the capital city to warn the King of the terrible threat that now faces his people."

    "For you are now the last of the Kai—you are now the Lone Wolf."
